# Existing Milestones:
1. "ENEC Vision Based Inspection Drone Feature"

    Revise to add 100 successful consecutive flight and reasonable operational complexity to be ready for containment dome demo.
    Very relevant to the "Ready for deployment / mission Flight Stack" criteria

2. "DroneLeaf Commissioning Workflow"
    Revise to do the demo flight for DFL and secure the follow-up contract.
    Revise to have a validation on the working of all demos without online tuning. Just to close what we have started without compromising other points.

3. "Ready for deployment / mission Flight Stack"
    **Acceptance criteria (revision)**
        Safe landing with degraded GPS/RTK -> Assume RTK works with altimeter available.
        Safe landing / behavior for errors on onboard sensors (redundancy in sensors) -> remove
        LTE related -> remove
    **Acceptance Test Case: [when relevant]**
        X650/X500 only

4. "Workshop"
    Needs to be revised completely to shape the first product offering

5. "Drone-Based Laboratory Sample Transportation in Abu Dhabi"
    Suggest we remove this or integrate with "Ready for deployment / mission Flight Stack"

6. "Contact-Based drone"
    Remove

7. "Tri-Copter Project Delivery"
    Delivered. Close it.
