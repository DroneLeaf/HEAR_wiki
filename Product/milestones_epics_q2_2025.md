# Existing Milestones:
## "ENEC Vision Based Inspection Drone Feature"

Revise to add 100 successful consecutive flight and reasonable operational complexity to be ready for containment dome demo.
Very relevant to the "Ready for deployment / mission Flight Stack" criteria

## "DroneLeaf Commissioning Workflow"
Revise to do the demo flight for DFL and secure the follow-up contract.
Revise to have a validation on the working of all demos without online tuning. Just to close what we have started without compromising other points.

## "Ready for deployment / mission Flight Stack"
**Acceptance criteria (revision)**
    Safe landing with degraded GPS/RTK -> Assume RTK works with altimeter available.
    Safe landing / behavior for errors on onboard sensors (redundancy in sensors) -> remove
    LTE related -> remove
**Acceptance Test Case: [when relevant]**
    ADASI/X650/X500 only

## "Workshop"
Needs to be revised completely to shape the first product offering

## "Drone-Based Laboratory Sample Transportation in Abu Dhabi"
Suggest we remove this or integrate with "Ready for deployment / mission Flight Stack"

## "Contact-Based drone"
Remove

## "Tri-Copter Project Delivery"
Delivered. Close it.

# New Milestones:
## "Mass Product Offering for Educational Users"
### Build user journey and the storyline for users (AB)

### Build your drone portal (MC-KH)

### Build online motor calibration and testing portal (MC-KH)

### Build online user-interactive pre-flight checks (MC-KH)

### Build online post-fsac trimming logic and flight analysis (MC-KH)

### Perform real-time controller tuning with FSAC (SY)

### Customize two missions for post-learning demo - Gripper and Camera gimbal (MC-AAr)

### Add computer vision and AI-based control of gimbal demo (SY)

### Add V1 support of PyLeaf SDK for student designed flight missions (SY)

### Add client support functionality in the portal (KH)

### Write the educational curriculum and host it in LeafWiki (AM)
The curriculum must serve all clients, not just educational.

## "Run the Workshop for RIT"
### Arrange for a motion capture system and cage (AB)

### Order necessary parts and hire/train for the drone workshop (MN)

### Pilot the workshop at RIT premises (MN)

### Conduct the workshop (AB)


## "Secure clients for the educational workshop" (AB)

## "Warehouse Inspection Demo"
Run the demo in KU facility without MoCap -> Check UAVLAS and VOXL2
### Integrate with a positioning system other than MoCap (MC)

### Setup a demo scene (MC)

### Integrate camera feed with barcode/QR code reads (SY)

### Generate a flight path and integrate with LeafMC and LeafFC pipeline (SY)

## "Expand the educational workshop to outdoor deployments" (out-of-scope for Q2)
