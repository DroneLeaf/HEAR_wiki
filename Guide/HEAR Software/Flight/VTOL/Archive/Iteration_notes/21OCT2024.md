## Notes for no doors version

- Transition is now defined by:
    - Elevators control by pitch and roll FF, not FB.
    - Vanes in their semi-closed position, not fully closed. Angle needs to be defined.

### Checks needed
- Check existing flight mode with doors. Specifically if M2 and M3 would turn-off.
