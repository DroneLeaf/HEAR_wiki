Copy the strucutre from https://droneleaf.github.io/petal-app-manager/getting_started/quickstart.html for sections

Keep the files maintainable. [separated based on speciality, so developer would no which file to update]

edit on the readme.md of the repository it self

separate the hearcli installation

reduce prerequisite and "next step" in the sub guides. as the person would be coming from the main guide

move the current content of the readme.md to a new file name contribution guide. 

Enhance the topology of the repositories with mermaid diagram

use references instead of repeating content

it is nice to keep checks, but as a separate section

Add contribution guide for each repository and project

Do not include logging in the command. Keep command clean, and just give a hint in single place to suggest the use of logging

vite press
