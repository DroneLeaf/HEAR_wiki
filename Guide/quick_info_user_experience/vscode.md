## VS Code Workspace Setup notes:
each cloned repository contains a `.vscode` directory with recommended settings and launch configurations for that specific repo:
- 'launch.json' for debugging configurations
- 'settings.json' for workspace-specific settings
- etc.
Do not edit and commit changes to these files unless you intend to share modifications with all users of that repository.
<!-- Note -->
> Note: tif configurations are not correct, please contact the repository maintainer for update.
