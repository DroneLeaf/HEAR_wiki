## Notes for next iteration

- In VTOL mode: prioritize pitch control over yaw for the canard.
- In VTOL mode: compensate for thrust loss due to:
    - M1: tilt and canard motion.
    - M2,M3: vanes movement.
- Forward control: use asymetric gain for tilt motion
- Split the control signal of the servos for rudders and ailerons
- Elevators down at VTOL.
- RC loss failsafe
- Direct connection with PX4 through WiFi/Wireless Link for easy settings of PX4.
- Observer design for dimensionless to physical quantities conversion. *Requires fixing the final design, refer to the Issue #1.*
- Measuring wind speed through a pitot-tube.
- Minimum M1,M2,M3 commands must prevent ESC stall.
- Ground speed is obtained from the GPS.
- Use new RC provided by the client.
