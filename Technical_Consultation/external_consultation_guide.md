This would save time for everyone.

It is the consultant responsibility to make sure all requirements are clear.

### Step 2: The consultant proposes a solution direction with different possible alternatives and the pros and cons of each

DroneLeaf would assess the proposed solutions and if found suitable, pricing and time-frame assessment takes place.

### Step 3: The conultant arranges the exact specs functional and non-functional with the client, and the exact delivery timeline.

It is the consutant responsibility to make sure all necessary tools for consultation success are present. If not, the consultant needs to check with the client immediately.

### Step 4: Demo the initial round of the developed solution.

To get feedback from the client and making sure expectations are aligned.

The demo must be part of the specs agreed upon in Step 3.

### Step 5: Final developed solution is delivered to the client
