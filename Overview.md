## Workshop Overview:

This workshop will be a demonstration of the automatic tuning software currently being developed by DroneLeaf LLC. Throughout the workshop attendees will get to customize their drones with their preference of propulsion system, payload, and battery. The drone will then take off performing the auto-tuning feature during liftoff and then head to the center of the test field to await further trajectory instructions. 

## Objectives:
Attendees will:
1. Customize their own drones.
2. Register using the website to obtain the product license.
3. Fly the drone and execute flight trajectory.

## Steps:
The workshop will go as follows:
1. Attendees shall be briefed in an introductory session on the procedure of this workshop and be introduced to the safety protocols that must be followed throughout the workshop.
2. Attendees shall assemble their respective drones and have them checked by DroneLeaf staff. Following, the Attendees will calculate the thrust to weight ratio of their drones and input the data.
3. Attendees shall use the online portal to obtain a product key that will be essential to use the flight control software.
4. Attendees will then go to the testing area and test fly their drones.

## Safety:
Following the safety guidelines during this workshop is paramount for a successful experience. 
When assembling the drone please use caution when handling the motors as the propeller tips are sharp. Handle the batteries carefully as dropping them could damage them and cause them to become hazardous, additionally when connecting the battery beware of touching any metal parts for fear of electric shock. 

During the flight test please wear goggles at all times to ensure adequate eye protection in the unforeseen event of an in flight failure. 
Although the software used in the workshop has been thoroughly tested it is still in alpha stage, and thus if any failure happens please **Do Not** enter the testing area, a DroneLeaf Officer will retrieve the drone safely for you. 

Finally once the workshop experience is complete please ensure all items are returned to their proper place to prevent loss of misplaced inventory.
